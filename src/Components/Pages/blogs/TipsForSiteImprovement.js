        <p>
          From start-ups to small scale businesses and right through well
          established brands, an eCommerce website is the best marketing tool
          anyone can ever have. It reflects your brand’s vibe and creates an
          overall impression of your business on the online visitors. Many of
          you might be wondering - “but I went into the business of online
          selling, not managing a website”; so let me tell you that without a
          well designed and a beautifully created website, you will neither be
          able to improve your brand reach nor you will be able to achieve your
          ultimate goal of starting the business. <br />
          <br />
          A good website helps you get easy conversions, build a strong,
          cohesive vision for your brand and is a centralised hub for all
          photos, videos and other customer engaging content. Your website is
          your sales tool and its importance for better growth and business
          expansion cannot be overstated. <br />
          <br />
          But not to forget that having an eCommerce website is not an easy
          peasy task because getting your site up and running is just the
          beginning. There are a lot many things you need to focus on like a
          great design, content with style and substance, graphics, blogs etc.
          in order to make a strong customer base and retain them. It must be
          properly managed, regularly monitored & updated and must run like a
          well oiled machine. Let’s throw some light on{" "}
          <strong>the importance of website management -</strong>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}seo-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              What will happen if your website is not on the first page of
              search engines? Your competitor will wind up getting the business
              and you will be left empty handed. Sounds like a nightmare right?
              Yes, it really is. That’s why maintaining a website properly while
              also ensuring SEO friendly content is important to rank higher in
              search engine listings and eventually get the business.

            <p>
              Do you want to attract new customers? Want to make the existing
              customers keep coming back? So, you need to properly maintain your
              website...A good design will solve half the battle and then comes

            <p>
              Your website is a reflection of your brand identity. Having said
              that, it’s important to make sure that your website has no broken
              links, outdated design or content, and is not confusing or
              difficult to navigate. If visitors who land upon your eCommerce
              site encounter any of the above mentioned issues, they will simply
              hop on to your competitor’s website and you will end up losing
              potential business. That’s why keeping up with the latest trends,
              ensuring that your website is properly functioning and is user
              friendly is extremely crucial for the growth of your online store.

            <p>
              The whole point of having an eCommerce website is to have an
              online store that is open 24*7 so that it is accessible to
              customers at all times and all places. However, if the site is not
              managed properly, it can hinder the shopping experience because of
              bugs and glitches, quickly shifting potential customers to your
              competitors. To provide a convenient shopping experience to your
              customers, it becomes crucial to maintain the site in a good
              manner.

          11 tips for website management
        </h2>

        <p>
          I'm sure the importance of maintaining a website is now clear to all
          of us. So let’s move onto the next step : how to improve your website
          performance? Here are 10 tips for website management to help you grow
          in the competitive battleground of ECommerce -

              1. Always backup your website
            </h2>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}backup-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              Hackers, power outages, human mistake and weather can all cause
              disaster at any time. If your website gets compromised,
              consistently backing up your data will protect you from losing
              vital information. It's also a good idea to double-check that a
              website restore can be done quickly in the event that your backup
              technique fails.

          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 className="secondary-font heading">2. Monitor Downtime</h2>

            <p>
              When a website goes down, sales fall down with it. Downtime costs
              around $137 to $427 per minute for small eCommerce enterprises.
              The larger the company, the higher the costs (for example,
              Amazon's downtime costs are reported to reach a staggering $12
              million per hour). Downtime not only costs you money, but it also
              reflects poorly on your company, turning off clients who expect
              perfection. So, if you're experiencing a lot of downtime, it's
              time to consider upgrading your hosting package or switching
              providers.

              3. Perform security reports every day
            </h2>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}reports-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              Customers want to trust you with their personal and financial
              information as security threats and malware are on the rise. The
              great majority of cyber attacks are automated and aimed to phish
              for information on your website, which frequently results in
              credit card fraud. Maintaining a website entails ensuring that it
              is secure and is built on the up-to-date architecture. It
              encompasses both passive (e.g., firewall configuration) and active
              management (e.g., conducting malware scans).

          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 className="secondary-font heading">4. Cross browser testing</h2>

            />

            <p>
              The layout of your website may change from one browser to the
              other. It might appear fantastic in Chrome, but not in Safari.
              It's critical to test your site across browsers to ensure that the
              user experience is consistent, as a broken or confused layout may
              irritate customers. You should also test your site on mobile
              devices using key browsers to ensure that it is fully responsive.

            </h2>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}metrics-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              Which traffic sources are bringing you visitors? How much time do
              they spend on the website? Which pages are the most popular? Which
              products are the most effective? These questions can be answered
              with data analytics and metrics, which can help you better promote
              your site to clients. This data will, of course, change over time,
              so this should be done on a frequent basis to ensure you don't
              lose out on possibilities to improve efficiency and, as a result,
              revenue.

              6. Take a look at the loading times
            </h2>

            <p>
              Is your website loading slowly? Are there any pages that take a
              long time to load? Testing your website's loading time at least
              once a month, and especially when you add new content, which might
              slow down load times, is part of website maintenance. Customers
              may leave the site out of annoyance if you fail to test and raise
              load times, resulting in lost purchases.

            <p>
              Your most valuable asset is your contacts, therefore make sure
              your website captures them! Fill out and test every form on your
              website on a regular basis to verify that no inquiry, contact, or
              sale is missed as a result of a broken form.

            <p>
              You can't develop a website and then leave it unattended. To reach
              its full potential, it must be updated on a regular basis to keep
              material fresh and customers returning. This will also help the
              site rank higher in search engine results, as new content is
              rewarded. Of course, don't forget about your product pages — keep
              those photographs and descriptions up to date, and don't forget to
              include links to your social media accounts.

            <p>
              Although the primary goal of your website is to sell, good content
              can attract visitors who would not otherwise visit. Other
              eCommerce companies communicate with customers using videos,
              podcasts, downloadable offers, and even live events like webinars,
              in addition to blog entries. If you want your website to create
              leads, website content management is essential, and it's also a
              terrific way to attract free traffic. It can also be simply
              disseminated from one person to another via social media.

            <p>
              Website management comprises discovering keywords that your
              clients are searching for and providing content that addresses
              those phrases, which is vital for generating traffic. You can use
              Google Keyword Planner or other keyword tools to find them.
              Because today's search engines are intelligent, generating
              low-quality content loaded with keywords will not help your cause;
              in fact, it may harm your ranking.

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}coupons-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              Offering coupons and discounts is a terrific approach to entice
              customers to visit your website because they love discounts. They
              do not want to pay full price while making online purchases.
              That’s why by regularly adding coupons and discounts on your
              website, you can easily boost sales conversion rates and increase
              customer loyalty.
