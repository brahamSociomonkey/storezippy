            A warehouse is a structure meant to store enormous amounts of products — or wares, as the Old English term goes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Not all warehouses are the same. Some are accessible to the public, while others are not. Some provide logistics services, while others just store products. Here's a rundown of the various sorts of warehouses.

          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 className="secondary-font heading big-heading">Different types of Warehouses</h2>
            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">1. Private Warehouses</h2>
            <p>A single corporation owns and operates a warehouse. Distribution centres, fulfilment centres, and storage facilities are all examples of private warehouses.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">2. Public Warehouses</h2>
            <p>A public warehouse is a storage facility where space can be rented. The only warehouse function provided by public warehouses is storage.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">3. Bonded Warehouses</h2>
            <p>Bonded warehouses are where imported products are held until they cross customs.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">4. Distribution Warehouse</h2>
            <p>Distribution warehouses serve as hubs in the wholesale products supply chain. They frequently combine inventory from numerous vendors to generate wholesale delivery for retail establishments.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="point-item">
            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">5. Fulfillment Warehouse</h2>
            <p> Fulfillment warehouses, often known as 3PLs or fulfilment centres, provide order fulfilment services to eCommerce businesses.
              <br/><br/>
              There are sub-types of warehouses within each kind. Many fulfilment centres, for example, offer specific services like as fulfilment for cosmetic products, cold storage and shipment for perishable commodities, or fulfilment for oversized items.

            <h2 class="secondary-font heading big-heading">What distinguishes warehouse services from third-party logistics?</h2>
            <p>One sort of warehousing service is third-party logistics, also known as 3PL. Fulfillment warehouses are third-party logistics providers that offer a specialised set of warehousing services.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="point-item">

            <p>Each fulfilment warehouse is unique. Most offer critical fulfilment services such as selecting, packing, shipping, and storage. Some 3PLs provide their clients with extra services such as kitting, inventory management, and cross-docking.
              <br/>
              <br/>

            <h2 class="secondary-font heading">3. Order Fulfillment</h2>
            <p>Order fulfilment refers to all of the steps required to send out your orders. When a customer clicks the Buy button, your 3PL receives an electronic copy of the transaction. This starts the picking and packing procedure. The final step in order fulfilment is to hand over the parcel to a carrier so that it may be delivered to your customer. This is also the last link in your supply chain.</p>
