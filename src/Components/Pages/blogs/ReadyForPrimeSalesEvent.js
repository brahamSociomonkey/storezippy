          What is Amazon Prime day?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Amazon Prime day is one of the biggest eCommerce sales events of the
          year and it was first launched in the year 2015. It is exclusive for
          prime customers offering great deals from more than thousands of
          online retailers. Initially, it was a one-day affair but due to the
          event’s popularity, the deal day now spans across two days. The prime
          day witnesses some amazing deals and price dropdowns on smartphones,
          laptops, TV’s, Cameras, electronic accessories and many more. With
          aggressive discounts and sales on popular categories, it is
          selectively available only to those who have subscribed to amazon
          prime membership.

          Getting ready for the big day
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Owing to the pandemic, eCommerce sales has already seen a big boom and
          it is all set to accelerate further with the two day amazon prime
          event. It is going to be a massive 48 hour sale offering huge
          discounts for amazon prime members on more than thousands of products
          in different categories. For sellers, this extravaganza shopping event
          is going to bring significant growth opportunities which means that if
          you are one of them, you need to prepare yourself well in advance.
          First thing you need to do is figure out what products consumers want
          more and see if your products fall under that umbrella of trending
          products. Categories like electronics, tech products and baby products
          do really well on the prime day while others like jewellery and
          apparels don’t. This doesn't mean that they don’t get sales at all,
          but not like other categories in this big sales event. But hey! Don’t
          get disappointed if your products do not fall under the best selling
          categories for prime day.
          <br /> <br />
          <strong>
            Read on!! It’s time to look further into preparing for the mega
            event -

            <h2 className="secondary-font heading">1. Know your goal</h2>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}goal-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              Consider your objectives as an online retailer as you begin to
              plan for Prime Day—you'll want to start as soon as possible to
              ensure the event's success. Do you want to boost your sales?
              Increase brand awareness? Move inventory? These are all factors to
              think about before deciding on a plan.

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg
              data={{ img: `${dirRoot}tactical-min.png` }}
            />

            <p>
              Many brands play smart. They sell the products complementary or
              related to those already on sale for the prime day. These brands
              turn out to be the most successful ones and are able to maximise
              their sales like no other.

            <h2 className="secondary-font heading">3. Improve Listings</h2>

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg
              data={{ img: `${dirRoot}listings-min.png` }}
            />

            <p>
              Another important point of focus is to improve the SEO and make
              your listings rank higher. When there are a million competing
              businesses vying for attention, making your product listings as
              clean and informative as possible makes your catalogue easy to
              discover and shop. In your listing names and descriptions, include
              keywords and phrases that consumers are already looking for. If
              not, your competitors will wind up the business.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another thing to keep in mind is that your picture stack should be
              high-resolution and illustrate exactly what's included in the
              product package. It may also be beneficial to provide
              instructional photos that demonstrate how to use your product.

            <ResponsiveDisplayImg data={{ img: `${dirRoot}ad-min.png` }} />

            <p>
              There are many brands which do not fall under the hottest
              categories of being sold on the prime day. What these brands can
              do is - “focus on advertising and retargeting”. Prime day for sure
              does one thing really well and that thing is bringing customers on
              the amazon platform. So if you think that giving discounts will
              eat into your margins needlessly, you can concentrate on
              advertising tactics and retargeting. There are chances that people
              who have visited your listings in the past 2-3 months will be
              browsing deals on amazon for the prime day. This means they are
              already in the buying mode and by putting the products in front of
              them again, there is a higher probability of them clicking the buy
              button on your product. This is how you can have a massive
              successful campaign.

            <p>
              Online retailers must be well prepared to handle the spike in
              demand for products and one of the most convenient and effective
              ways to do this is by outsourcing their fulfillment process.
              Fulfillment centres like StoreZippy are especially set up to
              handle the uplift in demands and consistent orders while also
              maintaining accuracy & efficiency. It’s never too late to switch
              to a 3PL.

              If you fail to choose the right software to manage your sales

              partners, the big day is going to turn out to be a nightmare for
              you. Investing in the right software and technology is critical to
              ensuring a scalable business that expands in accordance with
              continually expanding customer demand.
