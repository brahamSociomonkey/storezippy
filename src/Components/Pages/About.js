            The Store Zippy Story

            The ecommerce industry is recognized as the fastest growing industry
            in India. With this tremendous growth, the demand for warehousing
            and fulfillment is also expected to rise. We luckily spotted this
            ever increasing demand and realised the need of a reliable and a
            scalable 3 PL partner at the right time and that’s how StoreZippy
            was born.

          The first real stepping stone towards the inception of{" "}
          <strong>“Store Zippy” </strong>
          was <strong>“Socio Monkey”</strong>. SocioMonkey is a team of digital
          mixologists using technology, strategy, innovation and human
          brilliance to help build digital presence for not just ecommerce
          ventures but businesses of all types and sizes.
          <br />
          <br />
          It was founded by<strong> Mr. Neeraj Kathuria</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Mr. Vinay Aggarwal</strong> back in
          <strong> 2015</strong> during the early wave of ecommerce in India and
          we have come a long way since then. Warehousing and fulfillment has
          always been a part of what we do and to accommodate the company’s
          growing client base, the founders decided to create a separate
          division for the same. The idea was to create customised solutions
          that match your fulfillment needs and preferences, no matter your
          industry. This business idea was finally brought to life and is now
          known as “StoreZippy - Aapka Apna warehouse.” <br />
          <br />
          We are extremely proud of the company, its humble beginnings and the
          proven track record of enabling businesses to succeed.

          <strong>Mr. Kathuria</strong> and <strong>Mr. Aggarwal</strong>{" "}
          started their career as an Area Sales Officer with Channel Play, a
          Gurugram based startup. While working there they gained some valuable
          insights and realised the struggle people face to establish a strong
          digital presence and to grow their ecommerce business. It was then
          that they got an idea to build a company which helps bridge the gap
          between the brands, customers and the powerful digital media &
          ecommerce platforms. With this mesmerising idea in mind, these young,
          talented souls left their job at just the age of 23 and went beyond
          the barriers to start their own marvelous journey. <br />
          <br />
          Till now, they have helped over 200 brands establish a stronghold in
          the e-commerce sphere. After working on over 50,000 products and
          generating a revenue of more than 50 crores for them, they plan on
          adding more value to the e-commerce domain with the launch of Store
          Zippy.
